What makes me me? Well what makes me a human? A breath of fresh air in the morning. Watching the sun come up and syncing with my biological clock. A chill down the spine knowing I just avoided a near death situation. The rush of dopamine of making something that brings me fulfillment and makes people around me happy. Rejection. Failure. Pleasure. Pain. The one bite of something you've been savoring for a while, and it hits the spot. Taking a cool shower after being in the heat for so long. Laughing at a stupid joke with your closest friends, that might seem insanely absurd to the rest of the world. Family. Ambition. Sympathy.

Are we slowly hitting the peak of humanness??

Singularity will only be possible not just because of technological advances, but also the stagnating progress of humanity.
